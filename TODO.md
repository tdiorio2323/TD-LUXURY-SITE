## NOTES

### Priority Breakdown
- **NOW (Critical):** 4.5 hours - Must complete before launch
- **NEXT (High):** 12.5 hours - Complete in Week 1 post-launch
- **LATER (Medium/Low):** 30+ hours - Ongoing improvements

### Dependencies
- Stripe integration blocks premade design sales
- Email sending blocks lead generation
- TypeScript errors block strict builds
- Exposed secrets block secure launch

### Quick Wins (< 1 hour each)
1. Fix homepage service links (0.5h)
2. Add RESEND_API_KEY (0.5h)
3. Create robots.txt (0.5h)
4. Update snapshot test (0.5h)
5. Rotate API keys (0.5h)

### Technical Debt
- Next.js config ignores TypeScript/ESLint errors (for v0.app sync)
- In-memory rate limiting in contact API (loses data on restart)
- No database migrations system (Supabase only)
- Client access uses hardcoded passcodes (not hashed)
