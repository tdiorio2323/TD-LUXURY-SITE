(2) Fetched live site at https://tdstudiosny.com and confirmed Next.js deployment with Vercel edge headers. (3) DNS lookup via dig revealed Cloudflare nameservers (kayden/donna.ns.cloudflare.com) with A record 76.76.21.21 and Google Workspace MX records. (4) HTTP headers confirmed 308 redirects from HTTP→HTTPS and www→non-www variants. (5) TLS certificate inspection showed Let's Encrypt R10 issuer with validity Aug 17 2025 - Nov 15 2025. (6) Analyzed codebase for analytics integrations: found Vercel Analytics (@vercel/analytics/next) in app/layout.tsx line 78, custom gtag tracking functions in lib/analytics.ts but NO actual GA4/GTM measurement IDs in code or live HTML. (7) Confirmed OpenAI ChatKit integration via CDN script (cdn.platform.openai.com) loaded in layout.tsx line 70. (8) Verified robots.txt blocks /api/, /clients/, /signin, /_next/, /static/ and sitemap.xml contains 24 URLs with priorities 0.5-1.0.",

The site showcases portfolio work, service offerings (Web, Dev, Social, Design), and includes client-specific JWT-authenticated portals. Architecture: Vercel-hosted Next.js deployment with Cloudflare DNS/CDN, Supabase PostgreSQL backend for lead management, Resend for transactional emails, OpenAI ChatKit for support chat, and comprehensive custom analytics tracking infrastructure (currently instrumented but no active GA4/GTM ID deployed to production). Site implements glassmorphism luxury design system with mobile-first responsive patterns, A/B testing framework, and secure client portal authentication via jose JWT tokens.",
